# SwiftUtilities

This repository contains a small collection of Swift-language utility code I have written across
my macOS development projects. Rather than copy the source files back and forth across repositories,
I have decided to publish the sources here and use Xcodeâ€™s Swift Package Manager support to reference
them.

All code in this repo is licensed under MIT. Enjoy!
